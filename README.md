# React Big Calendar with React & Chart.js
This Project demonstrates how to integrate **React Big Calendar**.
It displays events on a calendar and highlight the selected Date

## Tech Stack
- **React.js** (UI library)  
- **Redux Toolkit** (state management)  
- **React Big Calendar** (calendar UI)  
- **Chart.js + react-chartjs-2** (charts)  
- **Moment.js** (date handling, can be replaced with native Date if needed)

## Installation & Setup
- git clone https://github.com/kamatchi1310/big_calendar_app.git
- cd big_calendar_app
- npm install


## Run the development server:
npm start


## Build for production:
npm run build

## Usage
- Open the calendar in the browser like (http://localhost:3000/)
- Click on any date
- If data exists → popup with bar chart appears.
- If no data → warning message: "No data found for the selected date".
- Use navigation controls (Today, Back, Next) to switch months/weeks/days.
- Switch views between Month / Week / Day / Agenda to see data differently.
